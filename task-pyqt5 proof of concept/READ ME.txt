This is a helloWorld program for the proof of concept of pyqt5 for GUIs

To install pyqt5 use:
'pip install pyqt5' to install pyqt5

To create a .exe file, i used pyinstaller instead of py2exe:

py2exe can work with python 3.7, but with cannot with pyqt5, to make it work i created the exe file
using py2exe and Pyinstaller, then got the missing Qt dlls from the resulting files from pyinstaller, 
What was missing is:
1. Qt Dlls
2. plugin folder containing some dlls
